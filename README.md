## :dart: About ##

Travela is an AirBnB like app built with React and Material UI for the frontend, and a backend of FastApi, a python framework using a postgreSQL database.

The app allows users to create and manage listings as well as the bookings for each listing. Users can also search for available listings and filter or sort them.

I was motivated to build this project in order to solidify my understanding of React, as well as to try a different backend framework to Express.js. I chose FastApi as I required a fast, lightweight solution, as well as for a way to build on my python experience.

The Backend of the project can be found at [Travela server](https://github.com/nicolunardi/travela-server)
